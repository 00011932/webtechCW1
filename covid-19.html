                <h2>Why you should be vaccinated ? </h2>
                <p>Millions of people in the United States have received COVID-19 vaccines 
                    since they were authorized for emergency use by FDA.
                    COVID-19 vaccines have undergone and will continue to
                     undergo the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S.
                      history. Learn more about how federal partners are 
                      continuing to closely monitor vaccine safety.
                    A growing body of evidence has shown that these vaccines
                     are safe and effective.
                    COVID-19 vaccines were developed using scientific
                     methods that have been around for decades.
                    Before recommending COVID-19 vaccination for children, 
                    scientists conducted clinical trials. The FDA gave the Pfizer
                     BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine emergency authorization to use in 
                     children ages 5 years through 15 years and full approval 
                     to use in people ages 16 years and older. Learn more about 
                     the process of developing, authorizing and approving COVID-19 vaccines.
                    Some people have no side effects from COVID-19 vaccines. Many people 
                    have reported side effects that may affect their ability to do daily 
                    activities, but they should go away within a few days.</p>
