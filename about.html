                <p>We would like to offer our deepest thanks to all the members of
                     hospital staff who made the last days of my mother, Sarah Jones,
                      so comfortable. We feel better knowing that those last few days
                       were full of the best possible care. The kindness of all the 
                       nurses to my mother and myself is something I will always treasure. 
                       If you could pass on my thanks to all the staff, I would be in your debt.</p>

                <p>Thank you so much for being extra careful about my health condition and general 
                    well-being. Throughout my stay at your clinic, I had no doubt I was in competent
                     and caring hands. Thank you again for providing excellent care to every
                      person admitted to your fertility center. Youâ€™re truly the best!</p>
